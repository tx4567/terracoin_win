Terracoin is a copy and paste cryptocoin that was abandoned by its original developer before it even got to the 1.0 version. It has suffered many problems in the past, including lack of developer interest and security issues.

The TRC Foundation has been formed to provide stable development, improved security, and better community involvement for a cryptocoin with over 14 million coins in circulation.

Terracoin Foundation Mission Statement

The TRC Foundation’s long term goal is to make Terracoin a flexible, secure and easier to use alternate to Bitcoin and fiat currencies.
